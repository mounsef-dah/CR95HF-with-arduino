# CR95HF with Arduino
This project demonstrates how to use the CR95HF NFC/RFID transceiver with an Arduino microcontroller. The CR95HF is a high-frequency transceiver that supports NFC peer-to-peer communication, NFC reader/writer mode, ISO 14443A and B, ISO 15693, and ISO 18092 protocols.

## Features

- Interact with NFC/RFID tags and devices using the CR95HF transceiver and an Arduino
- Read and write data to NFC/RFID tags using different protocols
- Example code for different modes of operation: peer-to-peer, reader/writer, and card emulation
- Compatible with different types of NFC/RFID tags and devices

## Installation

1. Connect the CR95HF transceiver to the Arduino using the appropriate pins and SPI interface.
1. Copy the code from the GitHub repository into a new Arduino sketch.
1. Modify the code to suit your needs, including the protocol used, data transfer mode, and other settings.
1. Upload the code to the Arduino and power it on.

## Usage

The CR95HF transceiver can be used in different modes, including peer-to-peer, reader/writer, and card emulation. The example code provided in this repository demonstrates how to use the transceiver in each of these modes, using different protocols and data transfer modes.

For more information, see the GitHub repository and the CR95HF transceiver datasheet.
